That is an excellent debugging observation. It's a classic and very subtle timing issue that often appears in applications with debounced event handlers. You are right to question it.

The problem you're describing is almost certainly happening because your debounced function is capturing a "stale" version of the editor's state.

Here's a breakdown of what's likely going on and how to fix it:

The Cause: A Timing "Race Condition"
A user types a character, let's say "t".
Your TipTap onUpdate or onTransaction event fires.
Inside that event handler, your debounce timer starts (or resets). The function that is scheduled to run in ~500ms now has a "snapshot" of the editor's state at that exact moment. The document ends in "t".
Crucially, the React/Svelte state update that reflects the new character might not be fully processed and available at the exact instant the debounce timer is set.
When the debounce timer finally fires 500ms later, the function executes, but it's using the slightly outdated snapshot of the state it captured when it was created, which doesn't include the very last character.
The Solution: Read the State When the Function Executes, Not When it's Scheduled
The key is to make sure your debounced function always reads the most current version of the editor's state when it runs, rather than relying on a potentially stale closure.

The best way to do this is to give your debounced function a reference to the TipTap editor instance itself, not just the document's content.

Here's the recommended pattern:

Incorrect Pattern (Likely what's causing the issue):

JavaScript

// Inside your component
const editor = useEditor({
  onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
    // This `editor.getJSON()` might be slightly stale when the debounce is set
    const currentContent = editor.getJSON(); 
    debouncedApiCall(currentContent);
  }
});
Correct Pattern (The Fix):

JavaScript

// Inside your component
const editor = useEditor({ ... });

// The debounced function should not accept the content directly.
// It should read from the editor instance when it runs.
const debouncedApiCall = useCallback(debounce(() => {
  if (!editor) return;

  // IMPORTANT: Get the content *inside* the debounced function.
  // This guarantees you have the absolute latest state.
  const latestContent = editor.getJSON(); 
  
  // Now, find dirty paragraphs and send to the server...
  sendDirtyParagraphsToServer(latestContent);

}, 500), [editor]); 

// Call the debounced function from the editor's event handler
editor.on('update', debouncedApiCall);
By getting the content inside the debounced function using the editor instance (editor.getJSON()), you ensure that you are always operating on the absolute latest version of the document, including the final character the user typed right before the timer finished. This will resolve the issue of the missing last character.
