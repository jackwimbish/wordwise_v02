Quick Wins for Spacing
Trust the Defaults: For components you pull from shadcn/ui, trust the built-in padding and margins. The developers have already made thoughtful decisions about spacing that work well for most use cases. Resist the urge to immediately override them.

Use gap for Stacks and Grids: When spacing items in a flexbox or grid container, always prefer the gap utility (gap-2, gap-4, gap-8) over adding margins to individual children. This is cleaner and avoids margin-collapsing issues.

Vertical Stack: flex flex-col gap-4
Horizontal Stack: flex items-center gap-6
Standardize Your Gaps: Don't use every possible gap value. Pick a few and stick with them for consistency. A good starting set is:

gap-1 or gap-2 for very tight groupings (e.g., an icon next to text).
gap-4 or gap-6 for spacing out distinct elements within a component (e.g., form fields).
gap-8 or gap-12 for separating larger sections on a page.
Use Padding for "Breathing Room": Apply padding (p-, px-, py-) to the parent container to give its contents breathing room, rather than adding margins to the child elements. For page-level containers, use classes like p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8 for responsive spacing.

Quick Wins for Font Sizing
Embrace text-sm as the Default: A key part of the "shadcn look" is its slightly more compact typography. Most shadcn/ui components like Button, Input, and Card default to text-sm (14px). Set this as the base font size for your application's body text in your globals.css for a cohesive feel.

CSS

/* in globals.css */
body {
  @apply bg-background text-foreground;
  font-size: 0.875rem; /* 14px */
}
Establish a Simple Typographic Scale: Don't go overboard with font sizes. A limited, clear hierarchy is more effective. Start with this and only add more sizes if absolutely necessary:

Body Text: text-sm (or text-base if you prefer larger text)
Subheadings/Labels: text-sm with font-medium or font-semibold
Headings: text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl
Microcopy/Captions: text-xs with text-muted-foreground
Use text-muted-foreground for Secondary Info: To de-emphasize text without changing its size, use the text-muted-foreground color utility. This is perfect for descriptive text under a title, placeholder text, or less critical information.

JavaScript

<CardTitle>Payment Method</CardTitle>
<CardDescription className="text-muted-foreground">
  Update your billing details and address.
</CardDescription>
By implementing these focused tips, you'll immediately notice a more consistent, refined, and professional look across your application, aligning it closely with the clean aesthetic shadcn/ui is known for.
